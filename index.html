    <p>My experiences setting up GitHub has been fine but the issue started when I had to publish from my visual studio code to a repository on GitHub, what I did not realize was that visual studio code works with Git desktop and not GitHub desktop. It took a fair bit of trouble shooting since I already had GitHub desktop installed I thought it would work fine with it.

        One interesting thing I learned about the web is that it could have been patented but the inventor Tim Berners Lee decided not to, it is interesting to think about how the world would be different today if they had decided to patent it. Another piece of information about the web that I found interesting about the web, although it is not about the history of the web is that the world wide web is different from the internet, such that the internet came before the web and the web is one use case of the internet.
        
        My goal for this course is to be able to create usable web pages that are user friendly and also informative, this web page will be very useful as my digital profile. another goal is to have a better understanding of the world wide web, understanding how a few lines of code can come together to make amazing and interactable visuals.

            <h2>Who am I?</h2>
            <p>
                By the time of publishing this website I am a third year game design student at the University of the witwatersrand. Although I don't have much experience in creating conventional art, my artwok happens on a breadboard and with jumper cables and integrated chips. I am a progammer and a designer all together, the programming languages that I am familiar with are C++, C# and thanks to this assignment HTML and CSS, I would also like to learn Java and Python, but that's saved for future endeavours.
            </p>

            <h2>What do I do?</h2>
            <p>
                Well I make games that only I play, but that's temporary. I also write great C++ scripts that work sometimes. And I also recreate electronic projects that I say on youtube. I am a jack of all trades, but I am a master of none, well at least for now.
            </p>

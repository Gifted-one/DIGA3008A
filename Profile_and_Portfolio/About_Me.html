            <h2>Who am I?</h2>
            <p>
                By the time of publishing this website I am a third year game design student at the University of the witwatersrand. Although I don't have much experience in creating conventional art, my artwok happens on a breadboard and with jumper cables and integrated chips. I am a progammer and a designer all together, the programming languages that I am familiar with are C++, C# and thanks to this assignment HTML and CSS, I would also like to learn Java and Python, but that's saved for future endeavours.
            </p>

            <h2>What do I do?</h2>
            <p>
                Well I make games that only I play, but that's temporary. I also write great C++ scripts that work, sometimes. And I also recreate electronic projects that I see on youtube. I am a jack of all trades, but I am a master of none, well at least for now.
            </p>

                What you just watched above was a project that I did with my group in our second year of study. We were tasked with creating a crypto box that would only unlock when the correct claps, taps and distance was entered to the system.

                    Capsule Mayhem is a first person shooter game that I created on unity. The game is a simple shooter game where the player is tasked with shooting down as many capsules as possible before the time runs out. The game was created also in my second year of study. You can download and play the game <a href="https://github.com/Gifted-one/Capsule_Mayhem">here</a>. <em>Disclaimer: The backgound was not created by me, I found it on the unity asset store, also the wapon. I only assembled them together in unity and gave them life.</em>

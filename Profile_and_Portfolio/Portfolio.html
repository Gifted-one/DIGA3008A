      <h2>Who am I?</h2>
      <p>
        By the time of publishing this website I am a third year game design
        student at the University of the witwatersrand. Although I don't have
        much experience in creating conventional art, my artwok happens on a
        breadboard and with jumper cables and integrated chips. I am a progammer
        and a designer all together, the programming languages that I am
        familiar with are C++, C# and thanks to this assignment HTML and CSS, I
        would also like to learn Java and Python, but that's saved for future
        endeavours.
      </p>

      <h2>What do I do?</h2>
      <p>
        Well I make games that only I play, but that's temporary. I also write
        great C++ scripts that work, sometimes. And I also recreate electronic
        projects that I see on youtube. I am a jack of all trades, but I am a
        master of none, well at least for now.
      </p>

      <h2>What have I done?</h2>
      <p>Glad you asked.</p>

          What you just watched above was a project that I did with my group in
          our second year of study. We were tasked with creating a crypto box
          that would only unlock when the correct claps, taps and distance was
          entered to the system.

        <p>
          Capsule Mayhem is a first person shooter game that I created on unity.
          The game is a simple shooter game where the player is tasked with
          shooting down as many capsules as possible before the time runs out.
          The game was created also in my second year of study. You can download
          and play the game
          <a href="https://github.com/Gifted-one/Capsule_Mayhem">here</a>.

            >Disclaimer: The backgound was not created by me, I found it on the
            unity asset store, also the wapon. I only assembled them together in
            unity and gave them life.</em

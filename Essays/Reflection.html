        <h3>A Reflection on the implementation of this website</h3>
        <p>
          As I reach the current stage of development on my website, I’ve had
          the opportunity to reflect on how both technical structure and ethical
          design principles have shaped my work. Throughout the process, I’ve
          been intentional about ensuring my work is not only functional, but
          respectful of both users and the technologies I rely on.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’ve structured my project files in a way that reflects the
          hierarchical information structure of my content. Each major page type
          (e.g. blog posts, designs, profile) has its own folder, reflecting
          their separation both in navigation and in content hierarchy. Within
          these folders, I’ve separated concerns clearly: HTML files handle
          structure and content, CSS files handle presentation, and JavaScript
          files handle interactivity.
        </p>

        <p>
          This modular structure made my website more scalable and maintainable.
          As I continue to build more pages or features, I can easily add files
          without cluttering or breaking the existing organization. The naming
          conventions I’ve adopted follow a clear pattern, which allows me to
          identify files quickly and maintain consistency across the project.
        </p>

        <p>
          In building the site, I’ve made conscious efforts to use semantic HTML
          wherever possible. Headers (&lth1&gt, &lth2&gt, etc.) clearly outline
          the structure of my content, providing both users and browsers with
          meaningful context. Navigation elements are expressed using &ltnav&gt,
          and sections are appropriately wrapped in &ltsection&gt and
          &ltarticle&gt tags where relevant.
        </p>

        <p>
          By using semantic elements, I’ve improved accessibility for screen
          readers and search engines, while also enhancing usability for all
          users. For example, the sidebar navigation not only orients sighted
          users, but provides clear landmarking for assistive technologies. I
          recognise that there’s always more room for improvement in fully
          expressing interactive elements like buttons and links with proper
          ARIA roles where necessary, but I think my use of semantic markup has
          laid a strong foundation for accessibility.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’ve included sufficient metadata across my pages to assist browsers,
          search engines, and social media platforms in correctly interpreting
          and previewing my content. Every page includes properly defined
          character sets and viewport configurations for mobile responsiveness.
          Descriptive titles and meta descriptions help search engines and users
          understand the purpose of each page.
        </p>

        <p>
          In addition, I’ve begun incorporating author metadata and Open Graph
          metadata for richer sharing on social media platforms. While there may
          be opportunities to include even more detailed metadata (such as
          article-specific metadata for blogs), I believe my current metadata
          structure balances completeness and practicality for this stage of
          development.
        </p>

        <p>
          Throughout my site, inline styling has been avoided as required,
          centralising all visual styling into dedicated CSS files. This has
          allowed consistency across pages while keeping presentation concerns
          separated from structure and logic. My CSS is modular and
          maintainable, with reusable class structures for elements like cards,
          buttons, and headers.
        </p>

        <p>
          Importantly, I’ve adopted responsive design principles using tools
          like flexbox and grid for adaptable layouts. This ensures my site
          remains usable across a range of devices, from large screens to mobile
          phones. I've also made heavy use of relative sizing units,
          specifically view width. This is very effective in the titles because
          it means they remain the same across devices. The visual design
          choices I’ve made also reflect my commitment to creating an
          expressive, human-centered space that aligns with my aesthetic values.
        </p>

        <p>
          JavaScript has played a key role in enhancing interactivity across my
          website. I’ve used JS to create interactive carousels, implement
          reading progress trackers, dynamically load content from external APIs
          (like GitHub repositories and quotes), and to improve navigation with
          features like hiding the navbar on scroll. These interaction points
          rely on event handling and DOM manipulation, all of which are
          expressed cleanly through external JS files and avoid inline
          scripting. Where possible, I’ve consolidated repeated functionality,
          such as handling scroll-based updates and rendering dynamic content
          into reusable functions.
        </p>

        <p>
          Beyond the technical structure, I’ve been intentional about embedding
          ethical considerations into every layer of my work. I’ve avoided dark
          patterns, prioritised user autonomy, and respected third-party
          services by using official APIs where possible. My progress tracker
          stores data locally rather than on a server, preserving privacy while
          still offering useful functionality.
        </p>

        <p>
          I believe that ethical design is not something added at the end — it’s
          baked into every decision: how I structure my files, how I label my
          content, how I present information, and how I enable interaction. In
          this way, both justice and care have become part of my creative
          materials, guiding my decisions throughout the development of this
          site.
        </p>

        <p>
          This website has been a learning curve throughout, from learning HTML
          to JavaScript. Along the way I explored how to make the web more
          assessable and how to avoid bad practices and learned how some big
          corporations are using dark patterns for their own advantage. Although
          my website is much better now than when it started out there are a few
          key areas which could use some improvements. like including more ARIA
          compliant elements could be used to further improve the accessibility
          of the website. Also include better page descriptions such that the
          site is easier to find and web crawlers have an easier job.

          The Intersections between the Internet, Geopolitics, and Digital
          Coloniality
        </h3>

        <p>
          In the contemporary world, the internet has evolved into more than a
          technological infrastructure; it has become a key arena where power,
          politics, and culture intersect and are contested. While originally
          framed as a decentralised and democratising force, the internet today
          reflects many of the global inequalities embedded in broader
          historical, political, and economic structures. In particular, the
          intersections between the internet, geopolitics, and digital
          coloniality have emerged as critical areas of analysis, revealing how
          digital technologies not only enable new forms of connection but also
          reproduce and entrench longstanding global asymmetries.
        </p>

        <p>
          Geopolitical struggles increasingly play out through control over
          digital infrastructures, regulatory frameworks, and data governance.
          Powerful states and multinational corporations compete to shape the
          architecture of the internet, asserting influence over everything from
          undersea cables to international standards. Simultaneously, patterns
          of digital coloniality replicate colonial-era dynamics of domination
          and extraction: data flows from the Global South to the Global North,
          cultural content remains largely Western-centric, and epistemic
          hierarchies marginalise non-Western knowledges. As a result, many
          countries in the Global South experience a form of digital dependency,
          where their participation in the global internet is mediated through
          structures controlled by external powers.
        </p>
        <p>
          This essay critically examines the intersections between the internet,
          geopolitics, and digital coloniality. Drawing on theoretical
          frameworks and recent developments, it explores how digital spaces
          have become arenas for geopolitical contestation while also
          perpetuating forms of colonial subordination in the digital age. In
          doing so, it highlights the urgent need to rethink digital governance,
          data sovereignty, and knowledge production in order to challenge these
          persistent inequalities.
        </p>
        <p>
          The expansion of Meta’s 2Africa undersea cable network presents a
          powerful example of how the internet, geopolitics, and digital
          coloniality intersect in contemporary global affairs. Positioned as
          one of the most ambitious connectivity projects in history, 2Africa
          aims to encircle the African continent with over 45,000 kilometres of
          submarine cable, promising to significantly boost internet capacity,
          reduce latency, and lower prices for consumers (Meta, 2020). On the
          surface, such a development appears to offer tangible benefits for
          African economies, potentially narrowing the digital divide that has
          long marginalised much of the continent in the global information
          economy (World Bank, 2019).
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet, when critically examined, the project reflects complex power
          dynamics that go far beyond infrastructure. While Meta and its
          partners frame the expansion as a philanthropic and developmental
          initiative, the reality is that control over digital infrastructure
          translates directly into political and economic power. Ownership of
          the cables allows corporations to control data routes, dictate terms
          of access, and extract significant value from the data flowing through
          these networks. In this way, digital infrastructure mirrors the
          colonial infrastructures of the past—railways, ports, and extraction
          routes—that were designed to facilitate the movement of resources to
          the benefit of external powers while offering limited local agency
          (Couldry and Mejías, 2019).
        </p>
        <p>
          In the context of geopolitics, the 2Africa project must also be
          understood as part of the broader global contest over digital
          dominance. The United States and China have both recognised that
          controlling the physical and regulatory architecture of the internet
          yields strategic advantages, leading to fierce competition over who
          builds, owns, and regulates critical digital infrastructure
          (Feldstein, 2019). Africa, long positioned on the periphery of these
          global struggles, finds itself increasingly caught between these rival
          blocs, with its digital sovereignty at stake. The presence of
          companies like Meta in Africa’s connectivity landscape is not simply a
          matter of service provision; it embeds the continent into a global
          system where data and profits primarily circulate back to corporate
          headquarters in Silicon Valley, not to African institutions (Mothobi
          and Gillwald, 2019).
        </p>
        <p>
          This raises profound concerns about data sovereignty and digital
          dependency. Despite the influx of foreign investment into African
          telecommunications, most of the platforms that store, process, and
          monetise African users’ data are based in the Global North. This
          dynamic risks reducing African states to mere sources of raw data—a
          digital equivalent of the raw material extraction that defined earlier
          colonial economies. As Graham (2014) observes, digital geographies
          often reproduce the same uneven patterns seen in earlier global
          economic structures, where the benefits of technological integration
          are unequally distributed. The Global North maintains its role as the
          principal architect and beneficiary of digital systems, while the
          Global South occupies a structurally dependent position.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the issue extends beyond economics into the realm of
          epistemic control. Control over digital infrastructure also means
          control over cultural representation, knowledge production, and global
          discourse. As Graham (2014) notes, much of the digital content that
          circulates globally is produced in a narrow range of languages and
          cultural contexts, often marginalising non-Western knowledge systems
          and worldviews. Even as access to the internet expands, the risk is
          that African voices remain peripheral, not due to lack of connectivity
          but because the platforms themselves favour certain types of content
          and cultural norms that reflect the interests and values of their
          owners (Birhane, 2020).
        </p>
        <p>
          The implications of this are significant. If African states and
          societies do not assert stronger governance over their digital
          futures, the expansion of connectivity may deepen existing
          inequalities rather than resolve them. Infrastructure alone is
          insufficient if it is accompanied by continued external control over
          data, algorithms, platforms, and cultural narratives. As Couldry and
          Mejías (2019) argue, digital coloniality operates through the
          extraction not only of economic resources but also of social and
          cultural value, shaping how individuals understand themselves and
          their place in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the same time, some African institutions and regional bodies are
          becoming more attuned to these challenges. The African Union’s Digital
          Transformation Strategy and emerging data governance frameworks seek
          to reclaim a measure of sovereignty over the continent’s digital
          development (African Union, 2020). Yet, these initiatives remain in
          early stages, often facing powerful resistance from entrenched
          corporate interests and the complexities of negotiating with foreign
          investors who control much of the capital and technical expertise
          needed to build digital infrastructure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond individual case studies, the intersection of the internet,
          geopolitics, and digital coloniality reflects broader systemic
          dynamics that shape the contemporary global order. To fully grasp
          these intersections, it is necessary to move beyond infrastructural
          concerns and explore how political, economic, and epistemic power
          operate simultaneously through digital technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
          At its core, the internet represents both a site and an instrument of
          geopolitical power. States have increasingly recognised that control
          over digital infrastructure, data flows, and governance frameworks
          equates to new forms of strategic influence. This has given rise to
          what some scholars describe as cyber-geopolitics — the use of digital
          technologies as tools for advancing national interests, projecting
          power, and safeguarding sovereignty (Maurer, 2018). For dominant
          powers, securing access to global digital infrastructures allows for
          expansive surveillance capacities, economic advantage, and the ability
          to shape global narratives. For weaker states, particularly those in
          the Global South, participation in the digital economy often comes at
          the cost of surrendering control to powerful multinational
          corporations or foreign states that own the platforms, cables, data
          centres, and regulatory standards upon which their digital economies
          depend (Feldstein, 2019).
        </p>
        <p>
          Digital coloniality builds on this geopolitical asymmetry by extending
          the logic of colonial domination into the digital sphere. As Couldry
          and Mejías (2019) argue, data colonialism operates through the
          appropriation of human life and social activity, transforming them
          into sources of profit for data capitalists primarily based in the
          Global North. Unlike earlier forms of colonialism that extracted
          physical resources, digital colonialism extracts informational and
          cognitive resources, commodifying personal data, social interactions,
          cultural production, and even intimate aspects of identity (Thatcher
          et al., 2016). This extraction is not merely an economic transaction
          but a reconfiguration of power that affects how knowledge is produced,
          how subjects are governed, and how futures are imagined.
        </p>
        <p>
          Crucially, digital coloniality operates not only through corporate
          extraction but also through normative and epistemic dominance. Western
          technological systems embed particular cultural values and assumptions
          into algorithms, platforms, and protocols. As Graham (2014) notes,
          most of the world’s digital content is produced and curated in a
          narrow set of languages, privileging Western worldviews while
          marginalising alternative epistemologies. Even when the internet
          expands to previously disconnected populations, it does so largely on
          terms defined by Western corporate and state interests, thus
          reasserting epistemic hierarchies that echo colonial patterns of
          knowledge exclusion (Birhane, 2020).
        </p>
        <p>
          The governance of the internet itself reflects these dynamics of
          exclusion. Global internet governance institutions, such as ICANN and
          the Internet Governance Forum, remain dominated by actors from the
          Global North, while voices from the Global South struggle to assert
          meaningful influence over key decisions (Kleinwächter, 2016). This
          governance imbalance reinforces digital dependency, as developing
          countries must navigate rules and frameworks that are shaped by the
          interests of others. Even efforts to establish alternative governance
          models — such as China’s promotion of digital sovereignty and
          state-led internet models — risk replacing one form of digital
          domination with another rather than empowering genuinely autonomous
          local governance (Deibert, 2015).
        </p>
        <p>
          At the intersection of geopolitics and digital coloniality, we thus
          witness a convergence of control over both infrastructure and meaning.
          Physical networks enable the movement of data across borders, but
          equally significant are the power structures that determine how data
          is used, who benefits from it, and whose knowledge is legitimised. As
          digital connectivity expands, so too does the risk of entrenching
          global hierarchies unless concerted efforts are made to build
          alternative infrastructures, diversify epistemic centres, and assert
          the right of digital self-determination for all nations and
          communities.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this context, calls for digital decolonisation are increasingly
          urgent. Scholars and activists have begun advocating for policies that
          promote data sovereignty, foster local content creation, support
          open-source technologies, and strengthen regional cooperation to
          challenge digital dependency (Ndemo and Weiss, 2017). Without such
          interventions, the promise of the internet as a democratising force
          may remain hollow, serving instead as a new frontier for 21st-century
          forms of domination that replicate and extend the legacies of
          historical colonialism.
        </p>
        <p>
          The intersections between the internet, geopolitics, and digital
          coloniality reveal the complex entanglement of power, technology, and
          historical structures in the contemporary digital landscape. While the
          internet was once heralded as a democratising force with the potential
          to empower previously marginalised voices, its global expansion has
          largely reinforced longstanding inequalities shaped by colonial
          histories and geopolitical rivalries. As the case of Meta’s 2Africa
          cable demonstrates, even projects framed as developmental
          interventions can perpetuate digital dependency, with ownership and
          control remaining concentrated in the hands of powerful corporations
          and states largely situated in the Global North.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond infrastructure, digital coloniality operates through subtler
          yet equally consequential mechanisms of epistemic domination, data
          extraction, and governance exclusion. Control over data flows, content
          curation, and platform algorithms privileges particular worldviews,
          languages, and cultures while marginalising others. Meanwhile,
          geopolitical contests over digital infrastructure and regulatory
          frameworks reflect the increasingly strategic role that digital
          technologies play in global power dynamics, leaving many countries of
          the Global South navigating an international system that continues to
          limit their sovereignty and agency.
        </p>
        <p>
          Confronting these challenges requires moving beyond narrow
          developmentalist narratives of connectivity to critically examine who
          owns, controls, and benefits from digital infrastructures and
          knowledge systems. Efforts towards digital decolonisation — including
          data sovereignty, regional cooperation, and support for indigenous
          knowledge systems — offer promising pathways for challenging these
          persistent structures of domination. However, such transformations
          demand sustained political will, institutional reform, and global
          solidarity to ensure that the internet becomes a genuinely inclusive
          space that serves the diverse interests of all peoples, rather than
          reproducing the hierarchies of the past in new digital forms.

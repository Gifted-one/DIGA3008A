        <h3>Decolonizing code</h3>
        <p>
          Decolonialism in the context of coding demands more than awareness—it
          calls for an active dismantling of embedded power structures that
          shape how software is imagined, built, and deployed. At its core,
          coding is never neutral. The assumptions that underpin programming
          languages, development tools, and design standards are deeply informed
          by Western epistemologies. The prioritisation of efficiency,
          abstraction, and modularity may be seen as universal virtues in
          programming, but they arise from Enlightenment-era logic and Cartesian
          dualism. This worldview privileges rationality, linear progress, and
          objectivity—values that often marginalise alternative ways of knowing,
          particularly those rooted in Indigenous, communal, or spiritual
          traditions. Thus, a decolonial lens encourages coders to question the
          supremacy of these paradigms and explore how pluralistic, relational,
          or cyclical knowledge systems might reshape what we think “good code”
          looks like.
        </p>
        <p>
          Digital infrastructure itself also reproduces colonial dynamics. Most
          of the world’s internet infrastructure—cloud platforms, DNS systems,
          server farms—is controlled by a small number of corporations in the
          Global North. When developers uncritically build on services like
          Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, or GitHub, they risk perpetuating
          dependencies that mirror colonial economic relations: centralised
          control, resource extraction, and asymmetrical benefit. In this way,
          the notion of digital sovereignty becomes central to a decolonial
          coding ethic. Developers must ask: whose data are we collecting, where
          is it stored, and who profits from it? Supporting decentralised
          architectures, open standards, and locally governed infrastructure can
          be meaningful steps toward resisting digital imperialism.
        </p>

        <p>
          Furthermore, the way we treat data mirrors colonial patterns of
          extraction. Just as colonial regimes plundered physical resources,
          today’s algorithms harvest behavioural data, linguistic patterns, and
          biometric information—often from marginalised communities—without
          consent or compensation. This is evident in facial recognition
          technologies trained on datasets collected from people in the Global
          South, or Indigenous languages scraped from online repositories to
          train AI systems controlled by Western firms. Decolonising code,
          therefore, involves building systems that centre consent, reciprocity,
          and data justice. It requires treating data not as raw material to be
          mined, but as cultural property embedded in social and historical
          context.
        </p>

        <p>
          Even open-source communities, often viewed as egalitarian and
          inclusive, are not immune from critique. Core contributors and
          maintainers are predominantly white, male, and Western, and
          participation often assumes fluency in English, familiarity with Git
          workflows, and a capacity to work without pay—assumptions that can
          exclude developers from underrepresented regions. A decolonial
          approach to open source demands a rethinking of contribution models to
          centre inclusion, mentorship, and flexibility. Projects should
          consider translating documentation, restructuring governance to
          reflect regional leadership, and creating spaces that honour local
          contexts rather than enforcing global homogeneity.
        </p>

        <p>
          The dominance of English in programming—both in syntax and
          documentation—also merits scrutiny. Language is not merely a medium of
          instruction; it shapes thought. Concepts like “variable,” “function,”
          or “object” encode particular worldviews. Programming interfaces, too,
          often assume left-to-right text flow, alphabetic ordering, and a
          Western visual logic that excludes those from oral cultures or
          non-Latin scripts. A decolonial practice of code would involve
          challenging the linguistic hegemony of English, promoting the
          development of programming languages and environments that reflect
          other epistemologies, and designing for linguistic and symbolic
          diversity.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our treatment of time within code further reflects colonial
          assumptions. Most digital systems operate according to the Gregorian
          calendar, UTC time zones, and linear conceptions of progress. Yet many
          Indigenous and non-Western cultures perceive time cyclically,
          seasonally, or relationally. When we hard-code Western time structures
          into our systems, we flatten and erase these alternative
          temporalities. A decolonial approach to time in code could involve
          designing for plural temporal frameworks, respecting local calendars,
          or allowing for spiritual and ceremonial timing in systems used by
          Indigenous communities.
        </p>

        <p>
          User interface and experience (UI/UX) design standards also privilege
          Western aesthetics—minimalist layouts, greyscale colour palettes,
          “uncluttered” white space—all of which stem from Euro-American design
          traditions like Bauhaus. Navigation metaphors like “folders” or
          “desktops” assume familiarity with Western bureaucratic systems. These
          may alienate users whose cognitive and cultural schemas do not align
          with these conventions. A decolonial UI/UX approach would begin with
          participatory design: involving communities not as test subjects but
          as co-creators of the visual and interactional grammar of their tools.
          This not only increases usability but affirms cultural identity
          through design.
        </p>

        <p>
          Even licensing regimes carry colonial baggage. Open-source licenses
          like MIT or GPL assume Western legal frameworks based on individual
          authorship and property. This runs counter to Indigenous and
          collectivist understandings of knowledge as communal, sacred, or
          intergenerational. Some communities may not wish for their knowledge
          to be “freely available” in the Western legal sense. Developers
          engaged in decolonial practice should explore or adopt alternative
          licensing models—such as Traditional Knowledge (TK) labels or
          community-use agreements—that prioritise ethical use, attribution, and
          non-exploitation.
        </p>

        <p>
          Labour inequality is another essential dimension. Much of the world’s
          codebase is written by underpaid developers in outsourced
          environments—particularly in countries historically colonised and
          economically disadvantaged. These workers often lack creative
          autonomy, working invisibly behind Western-facing products. A
          decolonial practice means advocating for fair pay, equitable working
          conditions, and shifting away from viewing Global South developers as
          disposable “cheap labour.” It also involves resisting the startup
          culture’s fetish for speed and disruption, which often relies on
          burning out underpaid coders and ignoring long-term social impact.
        </p>

        <p>
          Lastly, decolonialism urges us to confront the technosolutionist
          mindset that permeates programming culture. There’s a tendency to
          treat code as a fix for every social issue—without engaging
          communities or understanding historical context. This mirrors colonial
          paternalism: assuming that others need saving, and that external
          (usually Western) intervention is inherently beneficial. A decolonial
          approach calls for humility. It means resisting the urge to always
          build, and instead taking the time to listen, reflect, and collaborate
          with those directly affected by the technology.
        </p>

        <p>
          In summary, a decolonial coding practice is not a matter of adding
          diversity slogans or checking boxes. It requires deep structural
          transformation—rethinking how knowledge is produced, how power
          circulates, and who gets to decide what technologies are built, how,
          and for whom. It challenges us to unlearn dominance, question
          neutrality, and code with care, accountability, and solidarity. True
          decolonisation in tech is not metaphorical—it is political, and it
          begins with the code we write and the systems we choose to support.

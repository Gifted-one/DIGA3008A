        <h3>Social capital and the three levels of digital divide</h3>
        <p>
          Ruiu and Ragnedda's article presents a critical examination of digital
          inequalities through the lens of social capital theory, arguing that
          the digital divide operates across three interconnected levels: access
          (first level), skills and usage (second level), and outcomes (third
          level). Their framework demonstrates how pre-existing social,
          economic, and cultural capital shapes individuals' digital engagement
          and their ability to convert online activities into tangible offline
          benefits. By applying Bourdieu's theory of capital to digital spaces,
          the authors reveal how digital capital functions as both a product and
          reinforcer of social stratification, with privileged groups leveraging
          their offline advantages to gain further benefits online, while
          marginalized groups face compounded exclusion.
        </p>
        <p>
          The authors develop their argument through five key mechanisms where
          social and digital capital intersect: virtual communities (strong
          ties), weak professional ties, network expansion, online visibility,
          and trust in digital environments. Each mechanism illustrates how the
          internet reproduces rather than disrupts existing inequalities, as
          those with greater offline capital are better positioned to develop
          digital capital and use it advantageously. This analysis challenges
          techno-optimistic narratives about digital democratization, instead
          positioning digital inequality as an extension of systemic social
          hierarchies that requires structural, rather than merely technical,
          solutions.
        </p>

        <p>
          “Social, economic and cultural capital not only generate digital
          divide between people who can and cannot access the Internet (first
          level of digital divide), but also inequalities in terms of
          motivation, skills and purpose of use (second level of digital divide)
          and inequalities in terms of
          (social/cultural/economic/personal/political) benefits they can gain
          on-line (third level of digital divide).”
        </p>

        <p>
          This quote outlines the authors' conceptualization of the digital
          divide as a layered issue rooted in broader social inequalities. It
          reinforces that digital access is not just about owning a device or
          having an internet connection (first level), but also involves the
          competencies to use technology meaningfully (second level), and the
          ability to derive tangible value from it (third level). The framework
          here aligns with Bourdieu’s theory of capital, particularly his
          assertion that different forms of capital reproduce social structures.
          In this case, those with more economic, social, and cultural capital
          offline are better positioned to access and benefit from digital
          tools, thereby deepening existing inequalities. The authors reject a
          techno-utopian view and instead emphasize a structuralist
          interpretation of digital engagement, where power and privilege
          mediate participation.
        </p>

        <p>
          “Digital capital has the power to (re)produce inequalities,
          perpetuating processes of digital inclusion and exclusion and
          influencing one’s position in the social structure.”
        </p>

        <p>
          Here, the authors suggest that digital capital operates not just as a
          neutral resource but as a mechanism of social reproduction. The phrase
          “(re)produce inequalities” explicitly draws attention to how digital
          technologies can entrench existing disparities if left unaddressed.
          From a critical theory standpoint, this supports the notion that
          digital spaces are not inherently equitable; they are shaped by the
          same structural constraints that govern offline life. This idea
          resonates with Bourdieu's field theory, where individuals bring their
          capital into a field (in this case, the digital field), and their
          relative positions and possibilities are influenced by what they
          possess. Rather than levelling the playing field, digital capital
          often reflects and magnifies offline privilege, creating “digital
          elites” and further marginalizing disadvantaged groups.
        </p>

        <p>
          “People already endowed with a certain amount of capital in the
          offline environment tend to reproduce it online, strengthening their
          existing resources.”
        </p>

        <p>
          This quote supports the argument that digital inequality is not a new
          phenomenon but a continuation of long-standing social hierarchies in a
          different form. The internet, rather than acting as a space of
          democratization, becomes a platform for capital reinforcement. Those
          who have educational, economic, and social resources are more likely
          to exploit digital tools effectively, expanding their networks,
          knowledge, and opportunities. This insight corresponds directly with
          Bourdieu’s concept of “capital conversion,” where one form of capital
          (e.g. cultural) can be transformed into another (e.g. social or
          economic), thereby securing and reinforcing one's dominant position.
          Ruiu and Ragnedda thus make the case that policy efforts to reduce the
          digital divide must go beyond providing access—they must address the
          underlying inequalities that determine how digital tools are used.
        </p>

        <p>
          “Digital capital is not only an instrument to access information, but
          also a mechanism that affects individuals’ positions within the social
          hierarchy.”
        </p>

        <p>
          In this quote, the authors summarize a key point: that digital capital
          is not passive or purely technical—it is deeply social and political.
          It contributes to shaping social trajectories, granting some
          individuals and groups greater visibility, voice, and opportunity,
          while others remain digitally (and socially) invisible. From a
          critical media studies perspective, this statement challenges
          narratives that view technology as neutral. It calls for a more
          intersectional and justice-oriented analysis of digital participation,
          one that includes race, class, education, and geography as determining
          factors. Digital capital, like any form of power, can either liberate
          or exclude—depending on the broader socio-political context in which
          it operates.
        </p>

        <p>
          “It is important to understand how social inequalities are reproduced
          online and what forms of capital are necessary to transform online
          activities into real benefits.”
        </p>

        <p>
          This quote directly engages with the question of how structural
          inequalities are replicated in digital spaces. It implies that access
          alone does not guarantee benefit—individuals must possess certain
          types of capital (e.g. digital literacy, time, motivation) to convert
          online engagement into offline advantages. The authors are therefore
          applying a Bourdieusian framework of capital conversion, highlighting
          that digital participation is not uniformly productive. Those lacking
          in cultural and social capital may engage online but fail to achieve
          the same gains as those from more privileged backgrounds. This
          understanding calls for more nuanced digital inclusion policies that
          not only provide tools but also build capacity for effective,
          transformative use.
        </p>

        <p>
          “Social capital is not equally distributed among the population, and
          neither is digital capital. This leads to a situation in which digital
          resources are unequally used and unequally beneficial.”
        </p>

        <p>
          Here, the authors highlight the interdependence between offline and
          online forms of capital. Their assertion points to the systemic nature
          of inequality—social structures predetermine who gains the most from
          digital engagement. In this sense, digital capital, like social
          capital, becomes a mechanism of stratification. This quote supports a
          critical sociology of technology, one that resists technological
          determinism and instead sees digital participation as deeply embedded
          in pre-existing class, educational, and cultural hierarchies. From a
          critical realist viewpoint, it also suggests that digital inequality
          is symptomatic of broader societal issues and must be addressed
          through systemic social reform rather than solely through
          technological fixes.
        </p>

        <p>
          “The potential of the internet to generate social capital is higher
          for those who already have it.”
        </p>

        <p>
          This statement reinforces the cumulative advantage hypothesis: the
          internet amplifies benefits for those already in a position of
          strength. The authors underline how the digital realm mirrors the
          "Matthew Effect" (Merton, 1968)—the idea that the rich get richer. In
          this context, social capital acts as a multiplier; people with broad
          offline networks, high education, and confidence in navigating systems
          are better able to build and maintain digital relationships that offer
          further opportunities. Those without these advantages may use the
          internet but do so in less socially or economically fruitful ways.
          Thus, the internet's capacity to generate social capital is unevenly
          realized.
        </p>

        <p>
          “The digital divide is not a single gap to be bridged but a complex
          and multi-layered phenomenon that mirrors existing social structures.”
        </p>

        <p>
          This quote encapsulates the central argument of the article—that the
          digital divide is not just about physical access, but about layers of
          inequality tied to social status, education, income, and cultural
          practices. The authors reject simplistic binary understandings of
          "connected vs unconnected" and instead advocate for a stratified
          model, which aligns with Bourdieu’s theory of social space where
          various capitals interact to produce class distinctions. From a
          critical framework, this view challenges policymakers to address root
          causes of inequality rather than implementing surface-level
          interventions such as device distribution alone.
        </p>

        <p>
          The preceding analysis of key quotes from Ruiu and Ragnedda's work
          collectively underscores their central thesis: digital inequalities
          are not standalone technological issues but manifestations of deeper
          social stratification. Their Bourdieusian framework reveals how
          digital capital operates as a mechanism of social reproduction, with
          offline privileges being converted into online advantages through
          various forms of capital interchange. This perspective has significant
          implications for digital inclusion policies, suggesting they must
          address root causes of inequality rather than focusing solely on
          access provision. Ultimately, the authors provide a powerful
          theoretical lens for understanding digital participation as embedded
          within—and shaped by—existing power structures and social hierarchies.
          Their work makes a compelling case for approaching digital inequality
          as a complex, multi-layered phenomenon that demands intersectional
          analysis and systemic interventions.

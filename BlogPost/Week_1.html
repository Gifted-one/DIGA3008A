          My experiences setting up GitHub has been fine but the issue started
          when I had to publish from my visual studio code to a repository on
          GitHub, what I did not realize was that visual studio code works with
          Git desktop and not GitHub desktop. It took a fair bit of trouble
          shooting since I already had GitHub desktop installed I thought it
          would work fine with it. One interesting thing I learned about the web
          is that it could have been patented but the inventor Tim Berners Lee
          decided not to, it is interesting to think about how the world would
          be different today if they had decided to patent it.

          Another piece of information about the web that I found interesting
          about the web, although it is not about the history of the web is that
          the world wide web is different from the internet, such that the
          internet came before the web and the web is one use case of the
          internet. My goal for this course is to be able to create usable web
          pages that are user friendly and also informative, this web page will
          be very useful as my digital profile. another goal is to have a better
          understanding of the world wide web, understanding how a few lines of
          code can come together to make amazing and interactable visuals.

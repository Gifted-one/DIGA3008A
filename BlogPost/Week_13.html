          How I would approach justice and ethics in your artistic and
          programming practice
        </h3>
        <h3>Justice and Ethics in My Artistic and Programming Practice</h3>
        <p>
          As I continue to develop my personal website and expand my
          understanding of both visual design and programming, I find myself
          increasingly drawn to the ethical dimensions of what I create. I’ve
          come to believe that technical and aesthetic choices are never
          neutral, they reflect values, priorities, and power. Whether I’m
          working on navigation features, styling elements with CSS, or
          implementing JavaScript interactions, I’m making decisions that shape
          the experience of others. This is why I believe it's essential to
          embed a sense of justice and ethical responsibility into my artistic
          and coding practice.
        </p>
        <h3>Designing with Respect for Users</h3>
        <p>
          From the beginning, I’ve tried to be intentional about how users
          interact with my site. One of the key features I implemented is a
          carousel navigation component that displays three cards at a time. The
          middle card is dominant, and users can navigate left or right without
          being trapped in an infinite loop. I designed it this way because I
          want users to feel in control, not manipulated. I’ve seen many
          interfaces that disorient users with endless scrolling or unclear
          options, and I think that kind of design erodes trust. I want my site
          to provide clarity and structure, a space that users can navigate with
          ease.
        </p>

        <p>
          Another example of this is the reading progress tracker I built. As
          users scroll through a page, a bar and percentage update to reflect
          how much they’ve read. This information isn’t hidden or abstract, it’s
          presented transparently. I believe in making reading experiences feel
          engaging, but not gamified. This tool isn't meant to pressure users to
          finish quickly or consume more, but rather to support reflection. It
          tells users: “Here’s how far you’ve come,” and gives them a way to
          monitor their own pace.
        </p>
        <h3>Supporting Navigation and Orientation</h3>
        <p>
          Long-form content can often be disorienting. To address this, I added
          a sidebar that highlights which section the reader is currently
          viewing. I think of this as a way to respect the user's cognitive
          load. Rather than forcing someone to guess where they are on a page,
          the site tells them clearly. It provides orientation — like a digital
          signpost.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is where I see the link between usability and ethics. Ethical
          design is not only about avoiding harm, but also about making the
          experience thoughtful and supportive. When a website honors the user’s
          time and effort by making content easy to explore, it promotes a more
          just relationship between creator and audience.
        </p>
        <h3>Aesthetic Expression as Ethical Resistance</h3>
        <p>
          Aesthetically, I’ve chosen to work with bold, playful fonts like
          Dynapuff, strong black outlines, and a vibrant color palette. These
          decisions give my website personality, and I think that’s important.
          Too often, websites adopt cold, corporate minimalism that prioritizes
          performance metrics over expression. In contrast, I want my site to
          feel personal, human, and creative.
        </p>

        <p>
          This, too, is an ethical choice. I’m resisting the standardization of
          the web. I’m creating a space that reflects individuality and care. I
          think this matters because design communicates who we think we’re
          designing for. If my site looks and feels like it was made by a
          person, not a brand — then users may feel more welcomed, more seen,
          and more inclined to engage sincerely.
        </p>
        <h3>Rejecting Manipulation and Embracing Transparency</h3>
        <p>
          One of the most important values I bring to both my programming and
          design work is a rejection of dark patterns, the manipulative
          interface tricks that trick people into doing things they didn’t
          intend. I’ve seen these tactics used in cookie consent popups, email
          subscriptions, and checkout flows. I believe they undermine the web as
          a space of trust.
        </p>

        <p>
          On my site, I avoid pre-checked boxes, deceptive buttons, and obscure
          settings. If I ever request user input or data, it will be clear,
          optional, and respectful. While I currently don’t collect user data, I
          still think carefully about how I would handle privacy and consent if
          I did. I believe users should always know what’s being collected, why,
          and how to opt out.
        </p>
        <h3>Tracking Progress with Purpose</h3>
        <p>
          Another feature I implemented is a dashboard that tracks how much of
          each blog post or subpage a user has read. This is stored using local
          storage per page, so progress can persist between sessions and update
          only when users scroll further. The dashboard gives users a clear
          sense of where they’ve been, and helps them revisit unfinished
          content.
        </p>

        <p>
          What I find powerful about this feature is that it’s user-centered,
          not extractive. I’m not collecting data to optimize engagement or
          increase ad revenue, I’m offering a reflective tool. It supports
          memory, self-directed learning, and autonomy. I believe that’s what
          ethical digital tools should do.
        </p>
        <h3>Justice and Care as Creative Materials</h3>
        <p>
          To me, justice in digital design isn’t just about accessibility
          compliance or clean code. It’s about how I treat users — through
          layout, language, interaction, and aesthetic decisions. It’s about how
          I build systems that value users’ time, intelligence, and agency.
        </p>

        <p>
          That’s why I design interfaces that are clear and respectful, avoid
          manipulation, and celebrate personality. I want my site to be a space
          of care, not coercion. And I want the skills I’m building, in both art
          and programming, to reflect that. Justice and ethics aren’t
          afterthoughts; they’re part of the creative process itself.

    <h2>Week 1 blog post</h2>
    <p>My experiences setting up GitHub has been fine but the issue started when I had to publish from my visual studio code to a repository on GitHub, what I did not realize was that visual studio code works with Git desktop and not GitHub desktop. It took a fair bit of trouble shooting since I already had GitHub desktop installed I thought it would work fine with it.
        One interesting thing I learned about the web is that it could have been patented but the inventor Tim Berners Lee decided not to, it is interesting to think about how the world would be different today if they had decided to patent it. Another piece of information about the web that I found interesting about the web, although it is not about the history of the web is that the world wide web is different from the internet, such that the internet came before the web and the web is one use case of the internet.
        My goal for this course is to be able to create usable web pages that are user friendly and also informative, this web page will be very useful as my digital profile. another goal is to have a better understanding of the world wide web, understanding how a few lines of code can come together to make amazing and interactable visuals.

        <h3>Reflection on reading</h3>

        The essay by Moulthrop, S, "You say you want a revolution? Hypertext and the laws of media". In this extract Moulthrop touches on how Hypertext was envisioned by Theodor Nelson from Vannevar Bush's 1945 concept of Memex. Moulthrop elaborates on how Nelson popularized Hypertext and even brought forth the plans for a network of information, coordinated centrally by a linking and retrieval system he named Xanadu. Theodor Nelson’s concept of Xanadu imagined a universal hypertext system fostering a “docuverse” where all texts and ideas could be linked. In this extract Moulthrop examines hypertext using Marshall McLuhan's four "Laws of Media", he observed that it is said to reverse when taken to its limit. 
        The extract critically analyzes the origins of hypertext and the early days that inspired the world wide web. It then touches on the vision of hypertext, how it was supposed to replace mediums such as television instead of books. The extract also discusses how hypertext was supposed to advocate interactive mediums and textual exchange, but it was then dominated by large corporations that control how information is displayed to the media.
        The extract speaks to the internet today by addressing the potential of hypertext to create a medium where users can participate in the sharing of information, of which is similar to what the world of social media today. Also the extract looks at hypertext as a tool for authority and destabilizing traditional hierarchies, this relates to how social media influences people to tip over traditions they do not agree with and establish new ones that they are more comfortable with.

 

        <h3>Wireframes</h3>

        The idea behind the homepage is that there is going to be icons that depict the different sections such as the blog post and the essays. These icons are going to slide from left to right, which means one icon is visible on the screen at a time but the next and previous icons are going to be partially to show the viewers that there is more on the sides. This feels like it is going to create issues for mobile browsers since it requires space.Blog post page

        <img class="Blog_post_wireframe" src="../Images/Blogpost_wireframe.jpg" width="300" height="200"alt="Blog post wireframe" />

        <p>
        The blog post page is depicted in the above wireframe, on the side bar will be where the sections will be, the sections will be the weekly blog post. Putting each weeks blog post will aid the reader in navigating the page since everything will be clearly labeled. The other pages will follow roughly the same layout scheme as I feel if the pages are the same it gives the website a feel of uniformity.

        <h2>Blog 3</h2>
        <time datetime="2025-03-03">March 03, 2025</time>
        <h3>User Alignment</h3>
        <p>
          My website is envisioned as a fusion of functionality, artistic
          expression, and educational value, catering to both scholars and web
          development enthusiasts. It will serve as a personal learning archive,
          a platform for self-expression, and a resource for others interested
          in web development. The main goal is to document my learning process
          as I build my first website while providing insights into my journey
          and sharing information about myself. To achieve this, the website’s
          design must be functional yet artistic, balancing usability with
          creative expression. The interface should be clean and
          well-structured, ensuring that visitors can navigate effortlessly. At
          the same time, subtle artistic elements such as well-chosen
          typography, a refined color palette, and carefully placed visuals will
          allow for self-expression without overwhelming the user experience.
          The focus will be on clarity and engagement, ensuring that content is
          the centerpiece rather than excessive visual effects.
        </p>

        <h3>Site’s content</h3>

        <p>
          The website will feature several key sections to support its purpose.
          The blog post page will document each step of my web development
          journey, highlighting challenges, breakthroughs, and reflections. A
          profile and portfolio page will provide visitors with insights into my
          background, motivations, and aspirations. A design page will outline
          the reasoning behind each decision and element included on the
          website, additionally this page will showcase the design process and
          changes the website has gone through.
        </p>

        <h3>User experience</h3>

        <p>
          User experience (UX) plays a crucial role in ensuring that a website
          is intuitive, efficient, and enjoyable for visitors. A well-structured
          navigation system enhances usability by making it easy for users to
          find key sections such as "Home," "Blog post," "Design," and "Profile
          and portfolio." Features like a sticky navigation bar ensure users can
          switch between sections effortlessly, whereas a poorly designed menu
          can lead to frustration and difficulty in locating information.
          Aesthetically, a clean and minimalist design with ample white space,
          readable fonts, and a balanced color scheme enhances visual appeal
          without overwhelming users. Providing a dark mode/light mode toggle
          improves comfort, while excessive colors and flashing elements create
          a distracting and unpleasant experience. Additionally, interactive
          feedback mechanisms, such as hover effects on buttons and real-time
          form validation, provide users with immediate responses, improving
          engagement and usability.
        </p>

        <h3>Interface elements</h3>

        <p>
          While traversing the site, users should be able to interact easily and
          receive clear feedback on their progress. To enhance this experience,
          the website will implement clickable content that contrasts with the
          background, ensuring high visibility. Buttons and sliders will be
          clearly distinguishable, featuring a consistent color scheme that
          maintains visual coherence throughout the site. Additionally, a
          progress bar will indicate how much of the website the user has
          explored, while an interactive navigation bar will clearly highlight
          the current page or section. This navigation bar will also provide
          seamless movement across the website, improving usability. Users
          should also experience adjustability and adaptability, ensuring
          accessibility for a diverse audience across different browsers and
          devices. To provide users with greater control over their experience,
          the website will include adjustable font sizes and the ability to zoom
          in and out based on user preference. Furthermore, a light and dark
          mode toggle will be available, either manually activated or
          automatically adapting to the user's browser settings. By
          incorporating these interactive, accessible, and adaptable features,
          the website will create an engaging and user-friendly environment,
          allowing visitors to navigate intuitively while customizing their
          experience to suit their needs.

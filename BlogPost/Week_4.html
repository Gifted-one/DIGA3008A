            <h3>Color scheme</h3>
            <p>
            In <a href="Week_3.html">blog 3</a> post I mentioned that the color scheme needs to be balanced without overwhelming the user, yet it needs to be an artistic expression in a way.

            <img class="Hompage_wireframe_scheme" src="../Images/Coloured_Homepage_wireframe.png" width="300" height="200" alt="Picture of the homepage wireframe showing it's colour scheme" />
            </figure>
            The background color scheme for the website that I have chosen is depicted in the homepage wireframe above, the though process behind choosing the background color comes from purple being my favorite color, and since this website will be an expression of myself, this decision is justified.
            
            Although I intend to change the  background color depending on the page, this may clash with my requirements for the website to be uniform with the color scheme, but since the icons will be white throughout the whole site this will still meet the requirements for uniformity since it will go along with the bright background colors.
            </p>
             
            
            <h3>User flow</h3>
            <p>
            For the user flow I’ve decided to keep it simple with cycling icons on the homepage, this is to easily allow the user to choose which page to go to next and showing them all the available pages from the homepage to ease confusion.
            Most of the pages will have hyperlinks on them that will lead to either articles that I wrote or referenced articles on the internet. Pages such as the blogposts page will have further icons for each blogpost article so that the user knows enough about the blogpost before reading it.

            </figure>
            The below flow diagram below shows how the user can visit the websites and the flow into the pages.

            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>
            Website 1 proved to be a learning experience, since I was not familiar with HTML and its fundamentals. Prior knowledge in programming helped me problem solve immensely, and this was helpful since there were various issues that came to light. One of the issues that came to light was using the nav element to navigate pages, the issue came because of how I structured my folders and the hyperlink I had used as reference; the user could navigate to a page, but they couldn’t navigate to another page, they had to navigate to the previous page to continue.
            The HTML language seems interesting as it works as the bones of websites, to me it feels like a way to control how information is structured, stored and accessed. although it seems simple for me now, I have a feeling that the hardest part is yet to come.

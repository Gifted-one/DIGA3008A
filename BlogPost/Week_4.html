        <h3>IxD Process</h3>

        <h3>Color scheme</h3>
        <p>
          In <a href="Week_3.html">blog 3</a> post I mentioned that the color
          scheme needs to be balanced without overwhelming the user, yet it
          needs to be an artistic expression in a way.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img
            class="Hompage_wireframe_scheme"
            src="../Images/Coloured_Homepage_wireframe.png"
            width="300"
            height="200"
            alt="Picture of the homepage wireframe showing it's colour scheme"
          />
        </figure>

        <p>
          The background color scheme for the website that I have chosen is
          depicted in the homepage wireframe above, the though process behind
          choosing the background color comes from purple being my favorite
          color, and since this website will be an expression of myself, this
          decision is justified. Although I intend to change the background
          color depending on the page, this may clash with my requirements for
          the website to be uniform with the color scheme, but since the icons
          will be white throughout the whole site this will still meet the
          requirements for uniformity since it will go along with the bright
          background colors.
        </p>

        <h3>User flow</h3>
        <p>
          For the user flow I’ve decided to keep it simple with cycling icons on
          the homepage, this is to easily allow the user to choose which page to
          go to next and showing them all the available pages from the homepage
          to ease confusion. Most of the pages will have hyperlinks on them that
          will lead to either articles that I wrote or referenced articles on
          the internet. Pages such as the blogposts page will have further icons
          for each blogpost article so that the user knows enough about the
          blogpost before reading it.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img
            class="Blogpost_wireframe"
            src="../Images/Coloured_Blogpost_wireframe.png"
            width="300"
            height="200"
            alt="Picture of the blogpost wireframe showing color scheme"
          />
        </figure>
        <p>
          The below flow diagram below shows how the user can visit the websites
          and the flow into the pages.

        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          Website 1 proved to be a learning experience, since I was not familiar
          with HTML and its fundamentals. Prior knowledge in programming helped
          me problem solve immensely, and this was helpful since there were
          various issues that came to light. One of the issues that came to
          light was using the nav element to navigate pages, the issue came
          because of how I structured my folders and the hyperlink I had used as
          reference; the user could navigate to a page, but they couldn’t
          navigate to another page, they had to navigate to the previous page to
          continue. The HTML language seems interesting as it works as the bones
          of websites, to me it feels like a way to control how information is
          structured, stored and accessed. although it seems simple for me now,
          I have a feeling that the hardest part is yet to come.

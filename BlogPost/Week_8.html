        <h3>Digital Divide Widens</h3>
        <p>
          Tataki and Glynos’ blog, Digital Divide Widens, offers a compelling
          overview of how the COVID-19 pandemic deepened global digital
          inequalities, disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations.
          Over 1.5 billion students were impacted by school closures, yet half
          lacked access to a computer and 40% had no internet at home—exclusion
          most severe in low-income regions like Sub-Saharan Africa and among
          girls worldwide. In the workforce, only those in high-income,
          tech-based roles could transition to remote work, while low-paid and
          less-educated workers faced greater risks of unemployment, unable to
          telework.
        </p>
        <p>
          The blog powerfully illustrates how access to technology became a
          lifeline for education and employment during lockdowns. However, it is
          not just about having access, but also about the quality of that
          access, digital literacy, and the ability to use digital tools
          effectively. For many low-income families, owning a mobile phone does
          not equate to meaningful digital engagement, especially when online
          education requires stable connectivity or parental involvement. The
          digital gender gap, while acknowledged, deserves deeper exploration;
          in many communities, cultural norms and economic constraints make
          access even more difficult for girls unless gender-sensitive
          interventions are implemented.
        </p>

        <p>
          Temporary measures like lending devices or offering free data were
          helpful during the crisis but remain insufficient. The authors rightly
          argue that equitable access to digital infrastructure must become a
          lasting priority. Systemic solutions are needed: universal broadband
          access, particularly in rural and underserved areas; digital community
          hubs in libraries and schools; subsidies for devices and repairs; and
          culturally relevant digital literacy programmes. Long-term success
          also depends on inclusive policymaking that involves those most
          affected—youth, women, people with disabilities—to ensure solutions
          are relevant and equitable.
        </p>

        <p>
          Importantly, the blog frames internet access as a basic human right—a
          perspective that aligns with global development goals. Governments
          must treat digital inclusion as essential social infrastructure, not a
          luxury. Only through inclusive, sustained efforts can we ensure the
          internet becomes a tool for empowerment, not exclusion.
        </p>

        <h3>Internet Access is a fundamental right</h3>
        <p>
          Claire Daniolou’s blog, “The Need for Global Internet Connectivity,”
          presents a persuasive case for the expansion of internet access,
          especially in rural and underserved areas. While the blog effectively
          outlines the numerous social, educational, and economic benefits of
          broadband access—particularly in times of crisis like the COVID-19
          pandemic—it also acknowledges a critical, often underexplored aspect
          of digital inclusion: the potential dangers of internet misuse and the
          inadequacy of access alone without digital literacy.
        </p>

        <p>
          Daniolou rightly asserts that internet access is no longer a luxury,
          but a necessity for participation in modern society. However, she also
          recognizes that the internet is not inherently benevolent. One of the
          blog's strengths lies in its warning that, like any powerful tool, the
          internet can do harm if misused. Misinformation, manipulation, and
          online radicalization are real threats, particularly in environments
          where users lack the skills to critically evaluate digital content.
          These dangers are exacerbated by algorithm-driven echo chambers and
          the spread of disinformation, which can deepen social divisions,
          undermine democratic processes, and promote harmful ideologies.
        </p>

        <p>
          Furthermore, Daniolou touches on the risk of cultural erosion—where
          global internet culture, dominated by a few powerful platforms, can
          suppress local identities, languages, and traditions. While access to
          global networks can foster diversity and inclusion, without deliberate
          efforts to protect and promote local culture, digital connectivity may
          inadvertently contribute to cultural homogenization.
        </p>

        <p>
          The blog makes a crucial observation: access alone is not enough.
          Simply connecting people to the internet without equipping them with
          the knowledge and skills to navigate it responsibly can be
          counterproductive. In digitally naive communities, users may fall prey
          to scams, surveillance, or exploitative online practices. Therefore,
          any push for broadband expansion must be paired with comprehensive
          digital education—especially in critical thinking, data privacy, media
          literacy, and online safety.
        </p>

        <p>
          Although Daniolou briefly mentions the importance of technological
          education, the blog could have engaged more deeply with how such
          education can be effectively implemented. Questions remain: Who will
          deliver digital literacy programmes? How can these be culturally
          adapted and made accessible across diverse populations? How can
          vulnerable groups—such as the elderly, women in patriarchal societies,
          and people with disabilities—be included in these efforts?
        </p>

        <p>
          In summary, Daniolou provides a well-rounded introduction to the
          necessity of global internet connectivity, but her most important
          insight is that inclusion cannot stop at access. Without adequate
          safeguards, critical skills, and culturally sensitive education,
          expanding connectivity may replicate or even worsen existing
          inequalities. True digital inclusion requires not just infrastructure,
          but empowerment—and this demands long-term, participatory strategies
          that treat users not just as consumers of the internet, but as
          informed and capable digital citizens.

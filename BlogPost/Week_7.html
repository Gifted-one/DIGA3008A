        <h3>Toyota</h3>
        <p>
          The first website I found interesting is Toyota South Africa's
          website(<a
            href="https://www.toyota.co.za/?gclsrc=aw.ds&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwtJ6_BhDWARIsAGanmKe9E_rmAKLR8S4wjeKfsV2tsIyiFa0PRK0P4j2Eowucz3SPeJKBGPAaArIMEALw_wcB"
            >Toyota</a
          >) The homepage of the website has a lot of videos playing which can
          be frustrating since I can't stop them, although I can stop the next
          video from playing and it is clearly labelled which of those videos
          I'm watching, and I can skip to the one I'd rather watch. What I like
          about the website is that everything is clearly labelled the homepage
          has sections that keep you informed on the topic statement. I also
          like the visuals on the website, they are high definition such that
          even when scaled down they are still visible and all without
          sacrificing responsiveness too. I also like that the website goes for
          a neutral colour scheme with black, white and red so everything is
          clearly readable. Also, the website has a navigation banner right at
          the top that clearly indicates which page I am on so I as the user
          can't get lost.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now for the things that I find unpleasant, first there's a lot
          happening on the homepage which can be confusing at times and can make
          someone forget the point of why they're on the website in the first
          place. Another thing that I don't really like is that when I navigate
          away from the homepage to return back to the homepage the button for
          it is their logo, of which I find confusing because I would never
          think that a logo would be something to interact with, but I guess
          looking at it from a business perspective you would want to keep the
          customer looking at your product catalogue and not an irrelevant home
          screen.
        </p>
        <h3>BBD</h3>
        <p>
          Another website I found interesting is bbd software development's
          website(<a href="https://bbdsoftware.com">BBD Software</a>.). What I
          like about this website is that it is properly structured, each page
          starts on the top with a background image and a nice bold heading that
          contrast with the background image and the user is told to scroll
          down. I also like that there isn't a lot going on in the pages, the
          contents of that page will be what the heading is about, and all of
          the paragraphs are center aligned and there is ample whitespaces.
        </p>
        <p>
          What I don't like about the website however is that there isn't that
          much feedback to the user on what page they're on. To effectively
          navigate the site one needs to have very good memory as to not bounce
          back and forth between two pages you've already visited since the page
          titles are also unusual, even the page you're on isn't labelled you'll
          just click and it takes you back to the top of the page.

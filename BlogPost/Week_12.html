        <h3>What an ethical internet looks like to me</h3>
        <p>
          When I think about what an ethical internet should be transparent,
          user-centered, and respectful of human autonomy, I can’t help but see
          how starkly it contrasts with the reality of many commercial websites
          today. These platforms often prioritize conversion rates, retention,
          and ad revenue over user well-being, and one of the most troubling
          ways they achieve this is through dark patterns
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ve encountered them countless times: a newsletter pop-up with a tiny
          “No thanks” link hidden in a grey corner, or a “Confirm Shaming”
          button that tries to guilt me into staying subscribed, like when the
          decline button says “No, I don’t want to save money.” These design
          choices are not accidental; they’re intentional manipulations aimed at
          nudging me toward actions I might not otherwise take. And that
          manipulation sits in direct opposition to what I believe the internet
          should be.
        </p>

        <p>
          An ethical internet, to me, is about respecting agency, giving people
          clear choices and honoring their intent. It’s about making consent
          informed and freely given, not coerced through design trickery. When
          companies use pre-checked boxes for marketing emails or obscure how to
          cancel a subscription, they’re effectively stripping users of that
          agency.
        </p>

        <p>
          I also notice how dark patterns disproportionately affect people with
          lower digital literacy, limited language fluency, or cognitive
          disabilities. That raises serious concerns about inclusivity and
          equity — two values that an ethical internet must uphold. Instead of
          creating a web that empowers users to make informed decisions, dark
          patterns create confusion and exploitation.
        </p>

        <p>
          For me, the contrast is clear. Where an ethical internet is
          transparent, dark patterns are deceptive. Where it is inclusive, they
          are exclusionary. Where it is built on trust, they erode it.
        </p>

        <p>
          As someone who designs or writes for the web, I feel responsible for
          recognizing these tactics and actively resisting them. I want to build
          spaces where people feel respected, not manipulated and that starts
          with design choices that center ethics over metrics.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I reflect on the way many commercial websites use dark patterns,
          I start to see how power is encoded in design. Every popup that makes
          the “Accept all cookies” button big and bright, while hiding the
          “Reject” link in plain grey text — that’s not just poor design. That’s
          a power play. It shifts control away from me, the user, and back into
          the hands of the platform. And the more I learn about interaction
          design, the more I realize how deliberate that shift is.
        </p>

        <p>
          Dark patterns don’t just deceive; they also undermine trust in the web
          as a medium. Every time I hesitate before clicking a button because
          I’m unsure what it really does, is it submitting, subscribing,
          tracking me? I’m reminded that the interface isn’t neutral. It has
          motives. In contrast, ethical design is motivated by clarity, not
          conversion. It treats users as participants, not just targets.
        </p>

        <p>
          There’s also an emotional toll to these manipulations. Sometimes I
          feel guilt-tripped by a poorly designed unsubscribe form or
          overwhelmed by pre-selected checkboxes and endless opt-outs. These
          tactics exploit psychology — using friction, shame, or urgency to
          create compliance, not consent. I think about how many people aren’t
          even aware they’ve been manipulated until much later — maybe after
          they've been charged for a subscription they didn’t mean to start or
          shared data they didn’t intend to give away.
        </p>

        <p>
          What troubles me most is that these patterns are normalized. They’ve
          become standard practice, especially in e-commerce, newsletters, and
          cookie consent. But just because they’re common doesn’t mean they’re
          ethical. In fact, I think the frequency of dark patterns shows just
          how far the internet has drifted from its ideal, from a space of
          shared knowledge and empowerment to a hyper-optimized marketplace
          driven by metrics and behavioral engineering.
        </p>

        <p>
          And yet, I believe it’s still possible to resist that. I believe in an
          internet where ethical choices are visible in the interface, where
          opt-out is just as easy as opt-in, where language is plain, and where
          refusal is always respected. I believe in an internet that shows care
          through design, care for time, for consent, for accessibility.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a designer, developer, or even just a critical user, I feel a
          responsibility to question not just whether a site “works” but who it
          works for, and at what cost. Because every checkbox, every click path,
          every button label either respects or manipulates someone. And I want
          to be on the side of respect.

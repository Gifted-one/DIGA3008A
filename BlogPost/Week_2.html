        <h3>Reflection on reading</h3>
        <p>
          The essay by Moulthrop, S, "You say you want a revolution? Hypertext
          and the laws of media". In this extract Moulthrop touches on how
          Hypertext was envisioned by Theodor Nelson from Vannevar Bush's 1945
          concept of Memex. Moulthrop elaborates on how Nelson popularized
          Hypertext and even brought forth the plans for a network of
          information, coordinated centrally by a linking and retrieval system
          he named Xanadu. Theodor Nelson’s concept of Xanadu imagined a
          universal hypertext system fostering a “docuverse” where all texts and
          ideas could be linked. In this extract Moulthrop examines hypertext
          using Marshall McLuhan's four "Laws of Media", he observed that it is
          said to reverse when taken to its limit. The extract critically
          analyzes the origins of hypertext and the early days that inspired the
          world wide web. It then touches on the vision of hypertext, how it was
          supposed to replace mediums such as television instead of books. The
          extract also discusses how hypertext was supposed to advocate
          interactive mediums and textual exchange, but it was then dominated by
          large corporations that control how information is displayed to the
          media. The extract speaks to the internet today by addressing the
          potential of hypertext to create a medium where users can participate
          in the sharing of information, of which is similar to what the world
          of social media today. Also the extract looks at hypertext as a tool
          for authority and destabilizing traditional hierarchies, this relates
          to how social media influences people to tip over traditions they do
          not agree with and establish new ones that they are more comfortable
          with.

        <h3>Wireframes</h3>
        <p>Homepage wireframe</p>
        <figure>
          <img
            class="Hompage_wireframe"
            src="../Images/Hompage_wireframe.jpg"
            width="300"
            height="200"
            alt="Picture of homepage wireframe"
          />
        </figure>
        <p>
          The idea behind the homepage is that there is going to be icons that
          depict the different sections such as the blog post and the essays.
          These icons are going to slide from left to right, which means one
          icon is visible on the screen at a time but the next and previous
          icons are going to be partially to show the viewers that there is more
          on the sides. This feels like it is going to create issues for mobile
          browsers since it requires space.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img
            class="Blog_post_wireframe"
            src="../Images/Blogpost_wireframe.jpg"
            width="300"
            height="200"
            alt="Pictur of blog post wireframe"
          />
        </figure>
        <p>
          The blog post page is depicted in the above wireframe, on the side bar
          will be where the sections will be, the sections will be the weekly
          blog post. Putting each weeks blog post will aid the reader in
          navigating the page since everything will be clearly labeled. The
          other pages will follow roughly the same layout scheme as I feel if
          the pages are the same it gives the website a feel of uniformity.

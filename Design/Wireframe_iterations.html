            The above images illustrate the first ideas that I had of how the website should look like and how the user should interact with it. The first image is the homepage wireframe, it shows the layout of the homepage and how the user should navigate through the website. The second image is the blog post wireframe, it shows how the blog post should look like and how the user should interact with it. These were very simple and were only meant to solidify the ideas that I had in my head. they don't focus much into user experience and user interface.

            The above images now show an improvement from the first iterations of the wireframes. The homepage wireframe hasn't gone throught any changes as I feel that should be the signature look of my website, and I also feel that it offers simplicity as the sliding icons give the viewers the ability to see all of the pages contents without having to look at small icons. The blog post wireframe on the other hand has gone through some intensive changes, this changes make it such that now instead of the blog posts being on a single page, each blog post is now on its individual page and there is a page that will showcase all of these blog posts as icons with a short didcription of what the blog post is about.

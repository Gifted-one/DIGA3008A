            The above images illustrate the first ideas that I had of how the website should look like and how the user should interact with it. The first image is the homepage wireframe, it shows the layout of the homepage and how the user should navigate through the website. The second image is the blog post wireframe, it shows how the blog post should look like and how the user should interact with it. These were very simple and were only meant to solidify the ideas that I had in my head. they don't focus much into user experience and user interface.

        <h3>Style Guides</h3>
        <p>
          The styling and aesthetic of this website is meant to make the user
          feel welcomed with bright and contrasting colors, but not overwhelm
          the user with the color variation. The visual design elements I have
          selected, to begin with I have selected shape and scale to push the
          idea of which page I want the viewer to go to next from the homepage,
          this is seen in the side scrolling page cards of different sizes in
          the homepage creating dominance to the middle page card. The next
          element that will be widely used is whitespace, the whitespace will go
          along with the colors that will be used in the website to create
          contrast, this will be essential for increasing readability.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another element that will be used is value and color, these will be
          implemented in the form of shadows around the fonts giving a soft feel
          to the fonts, other than looking cool there hasn't been a clear reason
          as to why I'm including it but it isn't hindering readability as far
          as I can tell and I can't find a reason not to include them. The last
          element is line, this element will be used to wrap most of the text in
          a black border and the font color being used for the infill, this will
          further increase the contrast since black contrast better with white.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also plan to incorporate hierarchy by making the headings have the
          largest font size in the website and then working my way down the font
          sizes when working through the sub-headings all the way to the actual
          text. I will also implement balance and symmetry using center aligned
          headings and justify aligned paragraphs, navigation bars on the left
          of the screen and page indicators on the bottom center of the screen
          for the homepage.
        </p>
        <h3>Color Swatches</h3>

            class="Color_palette"
            src="../Images/Color_palette.png"
            width="500"
            height="400"
            alt="Picture the color palette for the website"
          />
          <figcaption>&ltColor palette&gt</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          The above image indicates the color swatches that will be seen on the
          website, the electric indigo is going to be used for the headings and
          the first sub-headings, Because the yellow doesn't contrast well with
          the white background it will only appear on text for the descriptive
          sub-headings that will appear rarely on pages but to combat the issue
          of contrast the letters will have a black stroke around them that will
          be thick enough to contrast with the black background. The yellow
          color will be mostly used for the buttons infill and the text on the
          buttons will be black. The Fandango will then be used for the footer
          and navigation elements will make use of the tropical indigo.
        </p>
        <p>
          The color scheme is geared at providing maximum amounts of readability
          and having comforting colors yet still conforming to the cartoony
          theme of the website.

        <h3>Font sample</h3>

            width="500"
            height="400"
            alt="Picture of the second font sample for the website"
          />
          <figcaption>&ltJetBrains Mono font sample&gt</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Above are the fonts that are going to be used on the website. The
          DynaPuff font will only be used for headings and sub-headings, this
          font will add to the cartoony theme of the website and since it works
          well with the black strokes around the text and the infill color. The
          JetBrains Mono font will be used for the main body text, button text
          and any text that will be strictly black, any text in this font will
          be encased in the triangular brackets as illustrated in the font
          sample, except for main body text. This font will contribute to the
          coding aspect of the theme of the website.
